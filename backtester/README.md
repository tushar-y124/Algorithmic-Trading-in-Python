There are five sections on the GUI, 
- Trading Mode
- Product Management
- Strategy Configuration
- Status & Logs
- Interactive Results

#### Trading Mode
- **Single Product Mode**: If you want to test one product at a time you can use this. Clicking on this will directly open file explorer and let you choose the data files.
- **Multi-Product Mode**: You can now trade multiple products at the same time using a single Strategy.py files. Clicking on this enables the **Add Product** and **Remove Product** buttons. Clicking **Add Product** will prompt you to enter the name of the product. **Please ensure you enter the correct name of the product with no spelling errors and also use this same name in your Strategy.py file**. Also, trying to run a single product in Multi-Product mode may not work. Use Single Product mode for that.

#### Product Management
- You can select the products you want to remove here and also view what files were selected for the prices data and the trades data.

#### Status & Logs
Will display any errors you might encounter during the backtesting. You may also find errors in the terminal. If you can't figure it out then ask a mentor.

#### Interactive Results

- **Open Interactive Dashboard**: Opens a HTML webpage generated by the GUI which displays PnL chart and Position chart. Disabled if you haven't run a backtest yet.
- **Performance Summary**: Self-explanatory. If it doesn't work, try again.
- **Export Results**: Saves a csv file of your PnL.

DM any mentor if you encounter an error, or post in the WA group chat.
